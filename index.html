        <span>Today I took a walk through the woods. It was relatively relaxing which was nice for once. I encountered some 
            birds and even saw a beaver. Seeing these majestic creatures up close made me realise how lucky I am to be here.
            If you are ever feeling down maybe you just need some fresh air and time to yourself. Who's to say if it will help,
            but I doubt it will hurt.
